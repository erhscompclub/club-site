	<heading><u>Physics</u></heading>
	</br></br>
	Physics. That 7-letter word that gives all s/t juniors nightmares and high anxiety. In games, however, physics can be a bit more manageable. If you’ve never heard of a ”Physics engine,” then you probably don’t know why you need to understand physics to make games. Actually, you only need to understand the physics that will feature in your game world. You don’t need to be a quantum mechanics major to make Candy Crush. You don’t even need to know how gravity works to make Tetris. In the real world, trillions upon trillions of atoms interact with force fields emitted by specialized particles. On our scale, this causes things like friction, magnetism, gravity, and electricity. In a game world, you can almost always simplify these things, depending on the kind of world you want to create.

	<heading><u>Collision Detection</u></heading>
	</br></br>
	Collision detection is probably the most confusing topic in this section. It’s simple to do, but the way it is explained can be abstract and difficult to visualize for some people. Anyway, here goes. Imagine a box surrounding each character on the screen. Each object you create in your code that you want to physically interact with other objects should have four variables: x, y, width and height. Now back to the box surrounding that character. Where is the box? Well, its left side is at the character’s x value. It’s right side is at x+width. It’s top is at y, and its bottom is at y+height. These boxes don’t really need to be programmed, they’re just a visualization. Since these boxes follow an object and share its dimensions, the box is essentially a representation of the object, right? And the best way to see if two objects are colliding is to check whether or not their boxes overlap. It’s easy to see when boxes overlap for us humans, but computers don’t think like us. They use math and numbers, so how can you tell when two boxes overlap using math? Well, if the right side of box 1 (x+width) is greater than box 2’s left side, but box 1’s left side (x) is less than box 2’s left side (I told you this was gonna get confusing), then they’re overlapping along the y axis. But what if the situation is reversed? What if box 1’s left side is less than box 2’s right side, and box 1’s right side is greater than box 2’s right side? Well, they’re still overlapping on the y axis in that case. That means that there’s two cases for you to check for. But what about overlapping on the x axis? Well, just take the mathematical process I described above and replace all x’s with y’s, and all width’s with height’s. That is how you check for an overlap along the x axis. Now, if box 1 and box 2 overlap along both the x and y axes, then they are touching and the two objects they represent are colliding with one another.

	Now, there is more than just one way to check for collision. What I detailed above was one of the simplest yet functional collision detection algorithms. In some projects, you may only want to test collision on one or two sides of a character. Or, you may want to know what side(s) in particular two objects are colliding on. I plan on doing a mini-lesson series about more minute details of game creation, and the first will go more in-depth on this topic. Until then, see what you can do with a simple yes or no collision detection algorithm.

	<heading><u>Gravity</u></heading>
	</br></br>
	In our world, gravity causes objects to accelerate towards the earth. Unless you’re making a game like Super Mario Galaxy, all you need to do is move characters downward at increasing speed to achieve realistic (or semi-realistic) gravity. To do this, just have yAcceleration and ySpeed variables for each character. Each frame, decrease the ySpeed variable by the yAcceleration variable, and increase the character’s y position by its ySpeed. Of course if the character’s feet are on the ground you probably want to set both yAcceleration and ySpeed to zero so the character won’t fall through the earth into the deep dark abyss that I call home ._.

	I’ve explained physics to enough of my classmates already, so if you want to do really real physics for your game I hope you have a background in physics already. Essentially, things move because forces are applied on them. F=ma, so the sum of all forces divided by the mass of an object is how fast they accelerate. As you know, you change your speed by an acceleration value, and you change your position by a speed value. Also good to remember is that forces, acceleration, and speed aren’t just just magnitudes, but directions as well. They are vectors. With a simple coordinate or magnitude and angle, you can store the data for a vector in your code. For gravity and such, one problem I used to run into was this: How do I use F=ma to get normal force to keep the characters from falling through the floor? The answer is simple. When a character lands on or jumps off of the ground, he/she exerts a force on the ground. Well, not just the ground, but the entire earth. The earth, according to Newton’s third law, exerts an equal force back at the character. That force is enough to launch the character up into the air (or at least counteract gravity, causing the player to not phase through the ground), but when divided by the earth’s colossal mass, it barely does anything to it. To have your characters jump using realistic physics, just have them exert a force on the ground sprite, whose mass should be immense (enough to make any force exerted on it yield a negligibly tiny decimal acceleration).
