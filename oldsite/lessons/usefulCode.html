	<heading><u>Random Number Generator</u></heading></br></br>
	Random number generators (or RNGs) are integral to many facets of game deisgn. Perhaps you want an enemy that moves randomly across the screen, or you want semi-randomized dungeon design for better replayability in your game. At any rate, you want to be able to write code that can generate a random number between a specified minimum and maximum. Here is some simple code that does just that:
	<code><xmp>
	function random(min,max){
		return Math.round(Math.random()*(max-min))+min;
	}</xmp></code>
	Let's take a look at this code piece by piece. This function returns a random whole number between <code>min</code> and <code>max</code>. <code>Math.random()</code> returns a random decimal from 0 to 1. Multiplying this random number by another number, like <code>(max-min)</code> (<i>x</i> for short), will change the value generated to 0 to x. Let's say 0 was generated by <code>Math.random</code>. Zero times x is still zero. If a 1 was generated, 1 times x is x. This is why multiplying the random number by a constant changes the maximum value generated. This value, however, is still a decimal. <code>Math.round()</code> fixes that by rounding the value to the closest whole number. After a whole number is randomly generated, it is added to <code>min</code>, the minimum value desired by the coder. If zero is returned, zero plus minimum is the minimum value specified by the coder. If x is returned (x in this case is <code>(max-min)</code>) then minimum is added to that. Max minus min plus min is equal to max, the maximum value desired by the coder.

	<heading><u>Loops</u></heading></br></br>
	Almost every game uses animation and graphics. But how does animation work? Well, images are drawn on a computer screen many times a second, each image slightly different than the last. This is what causes animation. Generally, the higher the frame rate (the amount of images drawn per second), the smoother the animation will look - even though frame rate isn't the only thing that affects animation smootheness. To achieve animation in games, we need to employ the use of update and draw loops. A loop is a function or piece of code that runs continuously. Have you ever heard of the joke <i>"Pete and repeat were on a boat. Pete fell off, who was left?"</i> The person being asked the joke is supposed to answer <i>"repeat"</i>, and the person asking the joke will ask it again. This continues on and on until either person decides to do something better with their life. That joke is an example of a loop - something that continuously goes on and on. 
	But we don't want to make a joke, we want to write code. Luckily for us nearly every functional language has a way to produce loops. In Javascript the best way to create an update/draw loop is this:
	<code><xmp>
	function update(){
		//add draw code here
		setTimeout(update,100);
	}
	update();
	</xmp></code>
	<code>setTimeout</code> tells the Javascript compiler to run <code>update()</code> again after 100 milliseconds (0.1 seconds). This gives our program a framerate of 10 frames per second, which is well able to produce smooth animation for html5 games. It's important to note that setTimeout cannot call any function that takes in parameters, so make sure your update function has none. <code>update()</code> calls itself after doing all its other tasks, so once you call it the first time it will run every 100 milliseconds until you stop your code.
