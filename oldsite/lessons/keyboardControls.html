	</br></br>
	There are two parts you have to code fi you want keyboard input functionality in your game. One of these parts is written in html, the other is written in Javascript. For the html code, you'll want to add an <code>onkeypress</code> attribute to your <code>canvas</code> tag. Give the attribute a javascript function as a value, with <code>event</code> passed in it as a parameter (something like <code>onclick(event)</code>). The onkeypress attribute in html adds an <i>event listener</i> to the canvas tag. An event listener is a part of the program that waits for a certain event to happen (such as a key being pressed or the mouse being clicked). When you press a key, the onkeypress attribute calls the Javascript function you passed as its value. Now, let's get to coding the Javascript portion of your keyboard input code.

	<heading><u>The Javascript Part</u></heading>
	</br></br>
	So you have a function like this:
	</br><code>onclick(e){}</code></br>
	<code>e</code> is the parameter for the function <code>onclick</code>. In the html portion of your code, you pass <code>event</code> as the parameter of e. This function will run whenever you press a key on the keyboard. Many games utilize keyboard controls, be they arrow keys for movement or the z button for special attacks. However, you would want a way to see which button specifically was pressed. To find which button was pressed, you can run this code snippet: <code>e.keyCode</code>. <code>e.keyCode</code> returns the <i>key code</i> of whichever key was pressed last. The <code>event</code> keyword that you passed into the onclick(e) function in the onkeypress attribute contains all the data of the pressed key. This includes the key code of the event. Each key on the keyboard is represented by a unique number (its key code). To see which key was pressed, just use a simple <code>if</code> statement. like so:
	<code><xmp>
		if(e.keyCode==39){
			//right arrow key was pressed. Move player right
		}
	</xmp></code>
	39 is the key code for the right arrow key. <a href="http://www.cambiaresearch.com/articles/15/javascript-key-codes">Here is a list</a> of all the keycodes on the keyboard.
