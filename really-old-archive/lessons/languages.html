	</br></br>
	Over the years, humans have created hundreds of different programming languages. Some languages are similar to each other in syntax (~grammar or structure) and vocabulary, forming parallels to real-world language families. That is to say, there are lots of different types of languages. Before I describe some of the hundreds of programming languages out there, let me first describe some of the types of languages that exist.</br>
		• Procedural: The first programming languages were <i>procedural</i>. Programmers created variables and functions all in one huge file. There was no creation or destruction of data (you did not create a new instance of a class, there were no classes). These languages were not as dynamic as their successors, Object-Oriented languages.</br>
		• Object-Oriented: Object-Oriented and Procedural languages are the two main types of programming languages. There are tons of smaller families that exist under these two categories. Object-Oriented programming was developed in response to Procedural limitations. With Object-Oriented programming, the programmer can create <i>classes</i>, which are like the outline for a custom object. An <i>object</i> is basically a collection of data (variables and functions), which makes data manipulation easier to understand by the programmer. Object-Oriented languages are more widely used today than Procedural languages.</br>
		• Multi-Paradigm: Programming paradigms are essentially styles of programming. Two popular paradigms are Procedural and Object-Oriented. Multi-Paradigm is exactly what the name suggests - a mix of two or more paradigms.</br>
		• C-based: This is the most common type of language for functional programming. Java, Javascript, Actionscript, are members of this language type. Some are procedural, some are object-oriented. These languages are primarily math-based, so they are mainly used for storing/manipulating data (thus making them essential tools for game creation).</br>
		• Markup: Markup languages include HTML and XML (which is more of a way to write data than an actual programming language). Basically anything that ends in ML ("Markup Language") is part of this family. Members of this family do not use any math, and so cannot be used to make a game without assistance from a more math-based language. Markup languages primarily use <i>tags</i> instead of variables or functions to store data. The prupose of Markup languages is to store data for use by more complex languages.</br>
		• Assembly Languages/Machine Code: Long ago, when the first computers were built, programmers used to write their code directly in binary (simply 1's and 0's). This process was difficult to master, took a long time, and was very expensive. To fix this, programmers began to develop the first programming languages, called Assembly languages. Assembly languages are all procedural, and are a step up from pure binary code in complexity. Assembly languages were the first of a type of language called "Low Level" programming languages. This means that every type of CPU has its own Assembly language associated with it. Assembly languages are extremely simple math-based languages that can directly manipulate computer memory and other hardware.</br>
		• Natural: Natural languages are modeled after human speech, such as English. One example of a natural programming language is LiveCode. Python and Applescript also use natural language concepts.</br></br>

	<table>
		<tr>
			<td><u>Language</u></td>
			<td><u>Type</u></td>
			<td><u>Description</u></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>C</td>
			<td>Procedural</td>
			<td>The progenitor of all C-Based languages. Long ago, all programs were made with Assembly languages. This all changed when Dennis Ritchie created a program called a <i>compiler</i>. This program could convert C (a language made by Dennis) into any of several Assembly codes. Thus was born the most popular early high-level language.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>HTML</td>
			<td>Markup</td>
			<td>HTML provides the bare bones of every webpage. HTML's tags store data for the basic elements of a webpage, such as text, pictures or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">links</a>. HTML tags can be visually altered by CSS. Javascript can be used to code functionality that interacts with HTML tags.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>HTML5</td>
			<td>Markup</td>
			<td>HTML5 is essentially the same language as HTML. The only difference is that HTML5's compiler was written to process new Javascript functions. These functions were designed to allow for more direct graphical manipulation on the webpage (the <code>canvas</code> tag).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Javascript</td>
			<td>Multi-Paradigm, C-based</td>
			<td>Javascript is like every programmer's common language. It is flexible, and is used to add functionality to every webpage on the internet. Like all C-based languages, Javascript has an extensive library dedicated to processing numerical data. In recent years HTML has been updated to allow for game creation with Javascript.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>CSS</td>
			<td>Procedural</td>
			<td>CSS is a very unique language, designed specifically for its task. CSS is used only to alter the styling on HTML tags. With CSS, you can create <i>stylesheets</i>. Stylesheets are like a set of artistic rules that can be easily applied to multiple webpages.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>XML</td>
			<td>Markup</td>
			<td>XML is often used to store data in a very orderly fashion. Javascript is used to access or alter the data stored in XML tags. XML is more of a way to store information rather than a full-fledged programming language.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>PHP</td>
			<td>Functional</td>
			<td>PHP is a language used to communicate between computers. It is used in conjunction with HTML and Javascript. Its syntax looks like Javascript's but with a bit of Bash mixed in. It is used to send SQL requests to servers.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>jQuery</td>
			<td>Functional</td>
			<td>jQuery is a large library of useful Javascript code. It allows you to more efficiently manipulate HTML code and properties. It's technically just an add-on to the Javascript language.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Actionscript</td>
			<td>Object-Oriented, C-based</td>
			<td>Flash programs (like games or cool internet animations) are written in Actionscript. The latest version of the language is Actionscript 3. Flash programming is often not as secure as Java, and so is vulnerable to viruses. Actionscript has many built-in visual or gaming-focused functionalities.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>C#</td>
			<td>Object-Oriented, C-based</td>
			<td>C# is an object-oriented language designed to be similar to C. C# is the main programming language used in Windows development/scripting, and even has a few applications in web development.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>C++</td>
			<td>Object-Oriented, C-based</td>
			<td>C++ originally began as an add-on to C. It was supposed to add object-oriented functionality to the language. The developers utlimately decided to make it its own language, though their original plan compromised the final product's design. C# later came to the rescue to improve upon C++.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Objective C</td>
			<td>Object-Oriented, C-based</td>
			<td>Of all the languages Apple could've chosen for their product development, why this one? It's horrendous. The syntax is terribly outdated and clunky. This language lacks elegance, but for a long time it was the only language you could built iPhone apps with. Luckily for us, it's been replaced by now.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Ruby</td>
			<td>Multi-Paradigm</td>
			<td>Ruby is a sleek interpreted scripting language. It comes built with many nice functions to simplify any programmer's job. It even hosts one of the best web database platforms, Ruby on Rails. Ruby never quite caught on as a general programming language (Python took that title), but its still used widely in certain areas of Computer Science. Not to mention it's such a pretty language.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Python</td>
			<td>Multi-Paradigm, Natural</td>
			<td>Python is a natural, interpreted general purpose language. It has many different applications and is designed to be closer to natural language. I like Ruby's syntax better, but Python is definitely more widely used as a general-use language. Its object-oriented support isn't very pretty at all, but Python is even more versatile than Javascript.</td>
