		<h2><u>The Golden Age</u></h2>
		<p>Long, long ago, in a mythical age long forgotten (I think it was the graduating year of 2014), 
		Computer Club was ruled by two twin dieties. These were Alex Yu, the Lord of Logic, and Javier, the Hercules of Hardware. 
		From the primordial conception of Computer Club many years before the twin gods' divine ascention, the club existed in a state of prosperity, known as the Golden Age. 
		Ever since the club's creation, however, a dark force sought to corrupt and destroy it. This force was an unnamable, unspeakable horror....so I decided to call it Phil. 
		This force possessed the members of Computer Club one by one. Where proud coders once sat to engineer the future of gaming in comfy swivel chairs, 
		internet n00bs now lurked, searching up hentai on Tumblr. The twin dieties did all they could to curb this destruction, but Phil was too powerful for them. 
		Eventually, Alex and Javier graduated, leaving two new deities (James and Pearl) to maintain order - or rather, what was left of it. 
		The following year, Computer Club completed its descent into chaos. No learning was done. No programs were completed. 
		Every week Mr.Pruszko's room was left with food wrappers on the tables, and nearby teachers complained of the unruly members. 
		Phil had won, and Computer Club (for the first time since its holy inception) did not host Epic Game Night that year. This dark age was known as the Age of Phil. 
		Despite such setbacks, James and Pearl continued to fight valiantly against the corruption of Computer Club, for a new hope would soon come to save them all.
		A new soon-to-be-ruler had joined the club...and his name was <strike>John Cena</strike> Dagmawi Sirak.</p>
