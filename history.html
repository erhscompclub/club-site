		<h2><u>The Golden Age</u></h2>
		<p>Long, long ago, in a mythical age long forgotten (I think it was the graduating year of 2014), 
		Computer Club was ruled by four benign dieties. These were Alex Yu, the Lord of Logic, Javier, the Hercules of Hardware, Sydney, the Artful Adept, and Pearl, the Treasurer. 
		From the primordial conception of Computer Club many years before this pantheon's divine ascention, the club existed in a state of prosperity, known as the Golden Age. 
		Ever since the club's creation, however, a dark force sought to corrupt and destroy it. This force was an unnamable, unspeakable horror....so I decided to call it Phil. 
		This force possessed the members of Computer Club one by one. Where proud coders once sat to engineer the future of gaming in comfy swivel chairs, 
		internet n00bs now lurked, searching up hentai on Tumblr. The dieties of the pantheon did all they could to curb this destruction, but Phil was too powerful for them. 
		Eventually, Alex, Javier, and Sydney graduated, leaving Pearl in charge with three demigods (James, Roy, and Keegan) to maintain order - or rather, what was left of it. 
		The following year (Year of 2015), Computer Club completed its descent into chaos. No learning was done. No programs were completed. 
		Every week Mr.Pruszko's room was left with food wrappers on the tables, and nearby teachers complained of the unruly members. 
		Phil had won, and Computer Club (for the first time since its holy inception) did not host Epic Game Night that year. This dark age was known as the Age of Phil. 
		Despite such setbacks, James, Pearl, Roy and Keegan continued to fight valiantly against the corruption of Computer Club, for a new hope would soon come to save them all.
		A new soon-to-be-ruler had joined the club...and his name was <strike>John Cena</strike> Dagmawi Sirak.</p>
		
		<h2><u>The Coming of Dagm and the Reconquista</u></h2>
		<p>Computer club had fallen. Its once-valiant members had been sucked into the Three Hells of Phil - Agar.io, Pretend You're Xyzzy, and the Weird Side of Youtube. 
		As the year came to a close, new hope shone through the bleak reality of Computer Club. Every summer vacation, Computer Club is destroyed and reborn again, like a Phoenix or something. 
		The annual Ragnarok of Computer Club brought about the temporary destruction of Phil, as well as a fresh start for the Year of 2016. It was this year that Dagm rose to power in the club. 
		On the last dreadful day of the Age of Phil, the demigod James turned to Dagm and said "Hey, you wanna be president?" and Dagm the Redeemer said "Lol sure why not?". 
		And thus did the Reconquista begin. Over the next two years, Dagm would fight to keep Phil's corrupting influence out of Computer Club.</p>
