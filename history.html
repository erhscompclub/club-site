		<h1>The Golden Age</h1>
		<p>Long, long ago, in a mythical age long forgotten (I think it was the graduating year of 2014), 
		Computer Club was ruled by dieties benign dieties. These were Alex Yu, the Lord of Logic, Javier, Roy, and some other guy. 
		From the primordial conception of Computer Club many years before this pantheon's divine ascention, the club existed in a state of prosperity, known as the Golden Age. 
		Ever since the club's creation, however, a dark force sought to corrupt and destroy it. This force was an unnamable, unspeakable horror....so I decided to call it Phil. 
		This force possessed the members of Computer Club one by one. Where proud coders once sat to engineer the future of gaming in comfy swivel chairs, 
		internet n00bs now lurked, searching up hentai on Tumblr. The four dieties did all they could to curb this destruction, but Phil was too powerful for them. 
		Eventually, Alex and Javier graduated, leaving just Roy and that other guy to maintain order - or rather, what was left of it. 
		The following year, Computer Club completed its descent into chaos. No learning was done. No programs were completed. 
		Every week Mr.Pruszko's room was left with food wrappers on the tables, and nearby teachers complained of the unruly members. 
		Phil had won, and Computer Club (for the first time since its holy inception) did not host Epic Game Night that year. 
		It was during this time - the Age of Phil - that a new ruler joined the club...and his name was <strike>John Cena</strike> Dagmawi Sirak.</p>
